              A paper with a crossword-like grid, along with some numbers. Some
              of the numbers are colored red or blue, and some of the cells are
              colored red or blue as well.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            I figured the objects surrounding the paper had meaning, otherwise
            the entire puzzle would just be the paper. The answer would most
            likely lie in the grid on the paper I thought, so I focused on that
            next.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The first thing I tried to do was make sense of the numbers. It just
            so happened that there were 12 rows of numbers in the bottom left of
            the paper, and there were 12 columns of numbers in the top right of
            the paper. It also looked like there was one red digit and one blue
            digit for each of the rows and columns of numbers, but one column of
            numbers had two blue digits, which was strange. Similarly, each row
            and column of cells in the grid had exactly one red cell and one
            blue cell. However, these numbers did not end up fitting into the
            grid, as there were grid entries of length 4 and 13, yet all numbers
            had length 5, 6, or 7.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Looking at the numbers more closely, I realized that the last two
            digits in each of the numbers were never $\geq$ 60. Likewise, the
            3rd and 4th last digits were never $\geq$ 60 either. So maybe these
            numbers were actually times! It would have been fitting with the
            title of the puzzle "Timely Journey". With the "journey" theme and
            the globe in the image, I figured these numbers were latitudes or
            longitudes in DDD° MM' SS'' format, where the degrees had 1-3 digits
            so every 5-7 digit number could be valid. A clue that supported this
            was that all the degrees in the length 7 numbers were $\leq$ 180,
            which was the maximum degree for longitudes. It was also suspicious
            that all the length 7 numbers were vertical, so maybe ALL the
            vertical numbers were longitudes, as longitudes run north-south.
            Likewise, all the horizontal numbers had degrees $\leq$ 90, the
            maximum degree for latitudes, so maybe the horizontal numbers were
            latitudes.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            At this point I had settled on the idea that the horizontal numbers
            were latitudes and the vertical numbers were longitudes. It was most
            likely the case that the latitudes were clues for the horizontal
            entries in the grid, and the longitudes were clues for the vertical
            entries in the grid. But how to convert these DMS coordinates into
            things that could fit in the grid? And how did the colored digits
            come into play? Did they indicate which part of the DMS coordinate
            to modify somehow?
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            So I turned back to the objects in the image for more clues. I
            realized that if I read them the right way, the Scrabble pieces
            spelled out "C JS 20 16 - 04", which is "see Jane Street 2016-04".
            Looking at the monthly puzzle of April 2016, there was a puzzle
            called "Long. Journey" where its given numbers were also in DMS
            format. So I had at least gotten the format of the numbers correct.
            Another thing that seemed to be intentionally placed in the image
            were the dice face up with 1s. With the Z pentomino to their left,
            it read "Z 1s" or "Z ones". Maybe "Zones"? As in time zones? That
            made sense with the name of the puzzle and the latitudes/longitudes.
            Well, it turned out that the plant to the left of the Z pentomino
            was actually a
            <em>thyme</em> plant, so it definitely read "Thyme Zones" (time
            zones)!
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            So time zones were involved somehow. In total, we had 12 latitudes
            and 12 longitudes, which is suspiciously the same as the number of
            UTC offsets. Latitudes and longitudes don't directly correspond to a
            specific time zone, as latitudes always cross over multiple time
            zones and longitudes can cross over multiple time zones that are
            offset by different amounts (e.g. China is all in UTC+8 despite
            spanning multiple longitudes). However, each longitude does have a
            unique UTC offset, so I decided to focus on the longitudes first.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            From left to right, the longitudes just so happened to fall in each
            odd UTC offset (+1, +3, ..., +11, -11, ..., -3, -1) if the correct
            cardinal direction (E or W) was assigned to each longitude. The
            first six longitudes being East and the last six longitudes being
            West. This was almost certainly not a coincidence. So if the
            longitudes got the odd UTC offsets, then surely the latitudes would
            get the even UTC offsets.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Since the puzzle was called "Timely Journey", we most likely needed
            to journey around the world through each of the 24 UTC offsets. Then
            each UTC offset would have a latitude or longitude clue that would
            reveal a location to visit, which we could then fit into the grid.
            This seemed like a very reasonable guess at this point, but I had no
            idea how to choose a location from a latitude or longitude. And if
            the colored digits meant modifying the latitude/longitude in some
            way, how would that work?
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            In case the colored digits did mean modifying the coordinates, I
            started by choosing a coordinate with the colored digits in the
            rightmost position. This way, any modification would affect the
            least significant part of the coordinate. The only coordinate with
            colored digits in the seconds position was the latitude 21° 14' 08''
            with a blue 0 and a red 8. Assuming the seconds would be modified,
            the only thing interesting I found with latitude 21° 14' N or 21°
            14' S were the Cook Islands. Specifically, the island of Rarotonga
            at 21° 14' S. This seemed promising, as the Cook Islands are in
            UTC-10, and 21° 14' 08'' lined up with UTC-10 in the latitude list
            assuming the even UTC offset pattern mentioned before. Perhaps we
            needed to travel to <em>islands</em> around the world? We also maybe
            didn't need to modify the coordinates, as 21° 14' 08'' S still
            landed on Rarotonga.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The next island I found was on 169° 51' 01'' W, which was Niue. The
            longitude 134° 59' 04'' W landed on the Gambier Islands. The
            Galápagos were on 0° 42' 29'' S. The Azores were on 25° 37' 56''.
            Fernando de Noronha was on 3° 50' 56'' S. Martinique was on 14° 39'
            57'' N. Madeira was on 32° 45' 06'' N. Bougainville was on 155° 23'
            32'' E. But these were the only islands that seemed like real hits.
            I couldn't find suitable island for 113° 29' 38'' W, which passed
            through the Americas. There was
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_%C3%81ngel_de_la_Guarda"
              class="link"
              >some island</a
            >
            that was a part of Mexico, but it was uninhabited and there was no
            airport on it. I mean, to get across the ocean, we needed islands.
            But maybe our coordinates didn't need to land
            <em>strictly</em> on islands.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Looking at major cities on 113° 29' 38'' W, I found Edmonton. That
            seemed alright, as the longitude did run straight through the city.
            Some other cities like Algiers on 03° 03' 19'' E and Nairobi on 36°
            49' 27'' E also seemed to work out. For the length 13 grid entry,
            30° 35' 28'' E passed through Yekaterinburg, which fit perfectly
            with Baku (40° 27' 00'' E) for the intersecting length 4 entry. Baku
            also had UTC+4 and Yekaterinburg had UTC+5, so the time zones might
            also be connected in order in the grid as well!
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            After a lot of searching and verifying, I finally had a full list of
            locations to visit for each of the 24 UTC offsets that also fit into
            the grid. Here is the full list of locations I ended up with:

            Now the only thing left was to figure out what the red and blue
            digits and cells meant. We had letters for each of the colored
            cells, but how did they relate to the colored digits? There was one
            thing in the image that I hadn't used yet: the pushpins. It was so
            strange how they were red and blue, at the top of the pushpin pile,
            and all facing the same direction. They were definitely
            intentionally placed like this. Looking in the direction the pins
            were facing, it seemed like they were pointing the "Shift" key on
            the keyboard the paper was sitting on. Shifting the letters in the
            colored cells by the colored digits for each latitude and longitude
            seemed like an obvious thing to do. One of the simplest things you
            can do with some letters and numbers is use a
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher"
              class="link"
              target="_blank"

            Starting from UTC+0 and going around in increasing UTC offsets until
            eventually wrapping around to UTC-1, we get the following strings of
            red and blue letters:
          </p>
          <div class="blog-math">
            \begin{align*} \text{Red letters: }\ &
            \text{ASCAAAEGHJIIKEGMNOSUMVRS}\\ \text{Blue letters: }\ &
            \text{REARKYBKAPNBLIAIADGLRDNZ} \end{align*}

            Let's see what happens when we shift these letters by their
            corresponding colored digits. The number of red digits matched the
            number of red letters, but this wasn't the case for the blue ones,
            as there were 24 blue letters and 25 blue digits. However, if we
            treated the longitude with the two blue digits 1 and 0 as having a
            shift of 10, then everything would line up perfectly. Below are the
            shifts for each of the colors:
          </p>
          <div class="blog-math">
            \begin{align*} \text{Red shifts: }\ &
            \text{090345211023298333009166}\\ \text{Blue shifts: }\ &
            \text{5302762144636[10]0949271507} \end{align*}
          </div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Performing a right shift, we get the following decoded strings:
          </p>
          <div class="blog-math">
            \begin{align*} \text{Decoded red letters: }\ &
            \text{ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSUVWXY}\\ \text{Decoded blue letters: }\ &
            \text{WHATREDLETTERSAREMISSING} \end{align*}
          </div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The red letters were nicely decoded to almost the entire alphabet in
            order, and the blue letters were decoded to the question "What red
            letters are missing?" The only red letters missing were T and Z, so
            the final answer to this puzzle was "TZ". This was kind of an
            underwhelming answer for such a long puzzle. "TZ" could mean "Time
            Zones" or "2026" (if you read the letters as numbers). These
            interpretations of TZ were in the image from the very beginning, so
            the answer was hidden in plain sight...

            I'm very proud of myself for getting this month's puzzle. I was 1 of
            53 people to solve it and the 20th person to solve it overall, which
            was my best rank on a puzzle so far! Having no problem statement and
            using an image as the only clue probably made it extremely difficult
            for AI to solve. This explains why this month's puzzle had the
            lowest solve rate out of recent puzzles, which get roughly 50
            correct submissions a day from what I've observed.
