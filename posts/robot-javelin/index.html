            I apologize for this post being a bit late! It was December: a time
            for festivities, my birthday, vacation, ...and finals. I also almost
            didn't get my solution in on time, as I attempted the problem on the
            very last day of the year. Anyway, here is Jane Street's December
            2025 puzzle,

              It's coming to the end of the year, which can only mean one thing:
              time for this year's Robot Javelin finals! Whoa wait, you've never
              heard of Robot Javelin? Well then! Allow me to explain the rules:
            </p>
            <ul
              style="

              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                It's head-to-head. Each of two robots makes their first throw,
                whose distance is a real number drawn uniformly from $[0, 1]$.
              </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                Then, without knowledge of their competitor's result, each robot
                decides whether to keep their current distance or erase it and
                go for a second throw, whose distance they must keep (it is also
                drawn uniformly from $[0, 1]$).
              </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                The robot with the larger final distance wins.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
              This year's finals pits your robot, Java-lin, against the
              challenger, Spears Robot. Now, robots have been competing
              honorably for years and have settled into the Nash equilibrium for
              this game. However, you have just learned that Spears Robot has
              found and exploited a leak in the protocol of the game. They can
              receive a single bit of information telling them whether their
              opponent's first throw (distance) was above or below some
              threshold $d$ of their choosing before deciding whether to go for
              a second throw. Spears has presumably chosen $d$ to maximize their
              chance of winning — no wonder they made it to the finals!
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
              Spears Robot isn't aware that you've learned this fact; they are
              assuming Java-lin is using the Nash equilibrium. If you were to
              adjust Java-lin's strategy to maximize its odds of winning given
              this, what would be Java-lin's updated probability of winning?
              Please give the answer in exact terms, or as a decimal rounded to
              10 places.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Before we attempt to exploit the "leak" in the game, let's first
            figure out how the fair version of the game works. We know the
            robots have settled into Nash equilibrium, so we should figure out
            the threshold for going for a second throw. Let's call this
            threshold $k$.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            To find the optimal $k$, the probability of winning by keeping the
            first throw must equal the probability of winning by going for a
            second throw at the threshold $k$. So we have
          </p>
          <div class="blog-math">
            \[ \text{Pr[We Win } | \text{ We Keep}] = \text{Pr[We Win } | \text{
            We Throw Again}] \]
          </div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            If we keep a throw $\geq k$, then we only win if Spears throws lower
            than $k$. For Spears to throw lower than $k$, their first throw must
            be less than $k$ (probability $k$), and then their second throw must
            also be less than $k$ (probability $k$). Thus,
          </p>
          <div class="blog-math">
            \[ \text{Pr[We Win } | \text{ We Keep}] = k \cdot k = k^2 \]
          </div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            If we go for a second throw, we win if our second throw is greater
            than Spears' final throw. There are two scenarios: either they keep
            their first throw or go for a second throw.
          </p>
          <ol class="case-list">
            <li>
              <p class="blog-paragraph">
                If Spears keeps their first throw, they must have rolled higher
                than $k$ (probability $1-k$). The probability that our second
                throw in $[0, 1]$ is greater than their first throw in $[k, 1]$
                is $\frac{1 - k}{2}$. Therefore, the probability of us winning
                in this case is
              </p>
              <div class="blog-math">
                \[ \text{Pr[We Win } |~(\text{We Throw Again } \cap \text{ Spears Keeps})] = (1-k) \cdot \frac{1-k}{2} = \frac{(1-k)^2}{2}
                \]
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="blog-paragraph">
                If Spears goes for a second throw, they must have thrown less
                than $k$ (probability $k$). The probability that our second
                throw in $[0, 1]$ is greater than their second throw in $[0, 1]$
                is $\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the probability of us winning in
                this case is
              </p>
              <div class="blog-math">
                \[ \text{Pr[We Win } |~(\text{We Throw Again } \cap \text{ Spears Throws Again})] = k \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{k}{2} \]
              </div>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Summing these two cases gives us the total probability of winning by
            going for a second throw:
          </p>
          <div class="blog-math">
            \[ \text{Pr[We Win | We Throw Again]} = \frac{(1-k)^2}{2} +
            \frac{k}{2} = \frac{k^2 - 2k + 1 + k}{2} = \frac{k^2 - k + 1}{2} \]
          </div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Setting the two probabilities equal to each other, we have
          </p>
          <div class="blog-math">
            \begin{align*} \text{Pr[We Win | We Keep}] &amp;= \text{Pr[We Win | We Throw Again]} \\ k^2 &amp;= \frac{k^2 - k + 1}{2} \\ 2k^2 &amp;=
            k^2 - k + 1 \\ k^2 + k - 1 &amp;= 0 \\ k &amp;= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1
            + 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \end{align*}
          </div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            We take the positive root since $k$ must be in $[0, 1]$, so
            $k=\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} = \varphi^{-1}$, where $\varphi$ is the
            golden ratio! So in a standard game of Robot Javelin, the robots
            will go for a second throw if their first throw is less than
            $\varphi^{-1}$. Note that this value is approximately $0.618$.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Now let's consider the modified game where Spears can receive a bit
            of information if our first throw is below or above a certain
            threshold $d$. To maximize their chances of winning, Spears should
            choose a threshold of $d = k = \varphi^{-1}$. This is because if our
            first throw is below $\varphi^{-1}$, they know we will go for a
            second throw, and if our first throw is above $\varphi^{-1}$, they
            know we will keep our first throw. This choice of $d$ maximizes the
            information gained for Spears.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Spears can adjust their strategy accordingly by changing their
            original threshold of $\varphi^{-1}$ to a new threshold $t$ based on
            the bit they receive. If Spears receives a bit indicating our first
            throw is below $\varphi^{-1}$, they believe we will go for a second
            throw that will be uniformly distributed in $[0, 1]$. In this case,
            Spears should make $t$ equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ to maximize their
            probability of winning, as it is the median of the uniform
            distribution.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            If Spears receives a bit indicating our first throw is above
            $\varphi^{-1}$, they know we have thrown a value in $[\varphi^{-1},
            1]$ and believe we will keep it. Spears can now do one of two
            things:
          </p>
          <ol class="case-list">
            <li>
              <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Spears can rethrow if their first throw is below $t$. Regardless
                of $t$, they will win with probability $\frac{1 -
                \varphi^{-1}}{2}$, as the probability that their second throw in
                $[0, 1]$ is greater than our first throw in $[ \varphi^{-1}, 1]$
                is $\frac{1 - \varphi^{-1}}{2}$.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Spears can keep their first throw as long as it's above $t$. If
                Spears keeps a throw $\geq t$, they win only if our throw is
                lower than $t$. Since our throw is uniformly distributed in
                $[\varphi^{-1}, 1]$, the probability that Spears wins by keeping
                their first throw is $\frac{t - \varphi^{-1}}{1 -
                \varphi^{-1}}$.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Like before, to find Spears' new threshold $t$, the probability of
            them winning by keeping their first throw must equal the probability
            of them winning by going for a second throw at the threshold $t$.
            Thus, we have
          </p>
          <div class="blog-math">
            \begin{align*} \text{Pr[Spears Wins } | \text{ Spears Keeps}] &=
            \text{Pr[Spears Wins } | \text{ Spears Throws Again}] \\ \frac{t -
            \varphi^{-1}}{1 - \varphi^{-1}} &= \frac{1 - \varphi^{-1}}{2} \\ t -
            \varphi^{-1} &= \frac{(1 - \varphi^{-1})^2}{2} \\ t &= \frac{1 -
            2\varphi^{-1} + (\varphi^{-1})^2}{2} + \varphi^{-1} \\ t &= \frac{1
            + (\varphi^{-1})^2}{2} \\ t &= \frac{1 + 1 - \varphi^{-1}}{2} \\ t
            &= 1 - \frac{\varphi^{-1}}{2} \end{align*}
          </div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            which was simplified using the identity $(\varphi^{-1})^2 = 1 -
            \varphi^{-1}$. Therefore, Spears' new threshold is $t = 1 -
            \frac{\varphi^{-1}}{2}$.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            So to recap, Spears' new strategy is to use the following
            conditional threshold:
          </p>
          <div class="blog-math">
            ${ t = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2}, & \text{if our first throw is } <
            \varphi^{-1} \\ 1 - \frac{\varphi^{-1}}{2}, & \text{if our first throw is } \geq \varphi^{-1} \end{cases} }$
          </div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Now we can calculate our updated probability of winning against
            Spears using their new strategy. There are two cases to consider
            based on our first throw:
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            If our first throw is above $\varphi^{-1}$ (probability
            $1-\varphi^{-1}$), we will keep our first throw. If we rethrow, then
            we reset to a random throw in $[0, 1]$, which has an average value
            of $\frac{1}{2}$. This is worse than keeping our first throw, so we
            will keep it.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            If our first throw is below $\varphi^{-1}$ (probability
            $\varphi^{-1}$), something interesting happens. Spears assumes that
            if our throw is below $\varphi^{-1}$, we will always rethrow. They
            then lower their threshold to $\frac{1}{2}$, which creates an
            opening. In the standard game, a throw of $0.60$ is considered "bad"
            (because it's below $\varphi^{-1}$). But against an opponent who is
            willing to keep a $0.51$, a throw of $0.60$ is actually quite
            strong! Therefore, we should calculate a new threshold $j$ for
            ourselves to decide whether to go for a second throw.
          </p>
          <ol class="case-list">
            <li>
              <p class="blog-paragraph">
                If we rethrow, we get a random value in $[0, 1]$. With a
                threshold of $t = \frac{1}{2}$, Spears has a $50\%$ chance of
                throwing below $t$, in which case they will rethrow. We have a
                $50\%$ chance of beating their second throw in $[0, 1]$. So
                there is a $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$ chance
                of us winning by rethrowing if Spears rethrows. If Spears keeps
                their first throw, they must have thrown above $t$, which occurs
                with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. The probability that our random
                throw in $[0, 1]$ then beats their first throw in $[\frac{1}{2},
                1]$ is $\frac{1 - 1/2}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$. Thus, there is a
                $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8}$ chance of us
                winning by rethrowing if Spears keeps. So in total, we have

              <div class="blog-math">
                \[ \text{Pr[We Win } | \text{ We Throw Again}] = \frac{1}{4} +
