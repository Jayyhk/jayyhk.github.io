            I apologize for this post being a bit late! It was December: a time
            for festivities, my birthday, vacation, ...and finals. I also almost
            didn't get my solution in on time, as I attempted the problem on the
            very last day of the year. Anyway, here is Jane Street's December
            2025 puzzle,

              It's coming to the end of the year, which can only mean one thing:
              time for this year's Robot Javelin finals! Whoa wait, you've never
              heard of Robot Javelin? Well then! Allow me to explain the rules:
            </p>

            <ul
              style="
                margin-bottom: 1em;
                margin-left: 2em;
                list-style-type: disc;
              "
            >
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                It's head-to-head. Each of two robots makes their first throw,
                whose distance is a real number drawn uniformly from $[0, 1]$.
              </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                Then, without knowledge of their competitor's result, each robot
                decides whether to keep their current distance or erase it and
                go for a second throw, whose distance they must keep (it is also
                drawn uniformly from $[0, 1]$).
              </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
                The robot with the larger final distance wins.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
              This year's finals pits your robot, Java-lin, against the
              challenger, Spears Robot. Now, robots have been competing
              honorably for years and have settled into the Nash equilibrium for
              this game. However, you have just learned that Spears Robot has
              found and exploited a leak in the protocol of the game. They can
              receive a single bit of information telling them whether their
              opponent's first throw (distance) was above or below some
              threshold $d$ of their choosing before deciding whether to go for
              a second throw. Spears has presumably chosen $d$ to maximize their
              chance of winning — no wonder they made it to the finals!
            </p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
              Spears Robot isn't aware that you've learned this fact; they are
              assuming Java-lin is using the Nash equilibrium. If you were to
              adjust Java-lin's strategy to maximize its odds of winning given
              this, what would be Java-lin's updated probability of winning?
              Please give the answer in exact terms, or as a decimal rounded to
              10 places.
            </p>

          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Before we attempt to exploit the "leak" in the game, let's first
            figure out how the fair version of the game works. We know the robots have settled into 
            Nash equilibrium, so we should figure out the threshold for going for a second throw.
            Let's call this threshold $k$.
