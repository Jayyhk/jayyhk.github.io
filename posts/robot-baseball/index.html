            Lately I've been wanting to get back into solving the monthly Jane
            Street puzzles. Back in the Summer of 2024 I solved a few of them,
            but I've been busy with other things since then. With a little more
            free time this semester, I decided to tackle the October 2025
            puzzle,

              The Artificial Automaton Athletics Association (Quad-A) is at it
              again, to compete with postseason baseball they are developing a
              Robot Baseball competition. Games are composed of a series of
              independent at-bats in which the batter is trying to maximize
              expected score and the pitcher is trying to minimize expected
              score.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
              An at-bat is a series of pitches with a running count of balls and
              strikes, both starting at zero. For each pitch, the pitcher
              decides whether to throw a ball or strike, and the batter decides
              whether to wait or swing; these decisions are made secretly and
              simultaneously. The results of these choices are as follows.

              By varying the size of the strike zone, Quad-A can adjust the
              value \( p \), the probability a pitched strike that is swung at
              results in a home run. They have found that viewers are most
              excited by at-bats that reach a full count, that is, the at-bats
              that reach the state of three balls and two strikes. Let \( q \)
              be the probability of at-bats reaching full count; \( q \) is
              dependent on \( p \). Assume the batter and pitcher are both using
              optimal mixed strategies and Quad-A has chosen the \( p \) that
              maximizes \( q \). Find this \( q \), the maximal probability
              at-bats reach full count, to ten decimal places.

            At first glance, this problem appeared slightly different from other
            problems I was accustomed to, like filling in a grid, finding some
            probability geometrically, or solving some cryptic riddle. This is
            the first puzzle I encountered that involved game theory. The only
            game theory knowledge I picked up was from AP Microeconomics in high
            school, but that information has long left my brain. The only thing
            I knew was that making a 2x2 payoff matrix would probably be useful.

          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Let \( P(b,s) \) be the expected points for the batter after \( b \)
            balls and \( s \) strikes. I'm calling this function \( P \) because
            it stands for "points".

            Ok great, we have some more information. Since our payoff matrix
            entries are the batter's expected points, we can construct a
            recurrence that gives the batter's expected value \( P(b,s) \) at
            each count \( (b,s) \) under optimal play by both sides.

            Let's break down this recurrence. At 4 balls, the batter earns 1
            point for a walk, and at 3 strikes, the batter earns 0 points for an
            out, and for other counts, the values of \( P(b,s) \) can be
            computed backwards from \( P(4,3) \) using the formula we just
            derived.

            Let us call this probability \( A(b,s) \), the pitcher's probability

            the letter \( A \) since I thought of "Event \( A \)" being the
            event that the pitcher throws a ball.

            This recurrence is a bit simpler than the one for \( P(b,s) \). If
            we get 4 balls or 3 strikes, the at-bat ends, so the probability the
            pitcher now throws a ball is 0 in these cases. Otherwise, we can
            just use our formula for \( A(b,s) \) and work backwards from \(
            A(4, 0 \ldots 2) \) and \( A(0 \ldots 3, 3) \) to compute all values

            really not that bad. Let's break it down. If we get 4 balls or 3
            strikes, the at-bat ends, so the probability of reaching a full
            count is 0 in these cases. If we already have a full count (3 balls
            and 2 strikes), then the probability of reaching a full count is 1.
            Otherwise, we can use our table above to compute \( F(b,s) \) in
            terms of \( F(b+1,s) \) and \( F(b,s+1) \). The first term in the
            core of our recurrence is \( (A(b, s))^2 F(b+1, s) \), which is
            multiplying the probability of the pitcher throwing a ball \( (A(b,
            s)) \), the batter waiting \( (A(b, s)) \), and the probability of
            reaching a full count from the new state \( (b+1, s) \). The second
            term is the sum of the first two ways we can get to the state \( (b,
            s+1) \), which have the same probability given in the table. The
            third term is the case where the pitcher throws a strike and the
            batter swings and misses, so we multiply by the probability of
            missing, \( (1-p) \).
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The last step is to find the value of \( p \) that maximizes \(
            F(0,0) \), the probability of reaching a full count when starting
            from 0 balls and 0 strikes. This maximum value is \( q \).

            >, we can find the optimal \( p \) in the interval $[0,1]$ that
            maximizes \( q \), assuming \( F(0,0) \) for each \( p \) is
            unimodal. The function we choose for the search will ultimately be a
            function of \( p \) because given \( p \), we can compute all values
            of \( P(b,s) \), \( A(b,s) \), and then \( F(b,s) \). Each of these
            tables can be computed with dynamic programming by working backwards
            from the boundary cases and following the recurrences defined above.

            \( F(0,0) \) appears to be a unimodal function of \( p \), which is
            good since golden-section search is designed for unimodal functions.

            I think this was a really fun puzzle that combined concepts from
            game theory, probability, and dynamic programming. I would like to
            make a post like this for each Jane Street puzzle every month going
            forward, so stay tuned for more write-ups!
